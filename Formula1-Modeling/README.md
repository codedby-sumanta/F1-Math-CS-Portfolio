# Formula 1 – Mathematical Modeling Projects 🏎️

This folder contains my personal experiments and studies where I apply mathematics and computational models to real-world Formula 1 scenarios.

## ✨ Why F1?
Formula 1 is a data-rich, high-performance sport where milliseconds matter.  
It provides the perfect sandbox to explore mathematical modeling, physics, optimization, and computational thinking.

## 🧠 Concepts I'm Exploring
- Lap time simulation
- Tyre degradation curves
- Pit stop optimization
- Acceleration & drag models
- Linear algebra in performance matrices
- Differential equations in race dynamics

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages
- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy)
- MIT OCW math foundations
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Publicly available F1 data

## 🚧 In Progress
These projects are part of my journey to combine applied mathematics and computer science with my love for motorsport. Expect ongoing updates, refinements, and new ideas!
