# Linear Algebra (MIT 18.06SC)

This folder contains my work from MITâ€™s Linear Algebra course.  
Topics include vector spaces, matrix operations, determinants, eigenvalues, and more.

## âœ¨ Goals
- Build strong intuition around vectors, transformations, and systems of equations.
- Apply concepts to real-world simulations and data models.
- Use Python/NumPy for visualizations and matrix computations.

## ðŸ“š Contents
- Notes
- Problem Sets
- Mini Projects
- Applications to Formula 1 (e.g., data modeling, performance matrices)

ðŸ“Œ Based on MIT OCW: [18.06SC Linear Algebra](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011/)
