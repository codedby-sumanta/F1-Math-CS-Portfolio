# Differential Equations (MIT 18.03SC)

This folder contains my studies in ordinary differential equations and their applications.

## âœ¨ Goals
- Understand first- and second-order differential equations.
- Apply DEs to motion, heat, circuits, and data-driven models.
- Connect theory to real-world dynamics like car acceleration and fuel burn.

## ðŸ“š Contents
- Theory notes and visual diagrams
- Problem sets and solutions
- Code-based simulations
- Applications to F1 and physics modeling

ðŸ“Œ Based on MIT OCW: [18.03SC Differential Equations](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-03sc-differential-equations-fall-2011/)
